Why waste time and money paying for a Ticket Tracker when you already work in GitHub? Now, you don't have to.

# Features

### Multiple Repositories

Multiple Repositories in an organization can be shown on a board (from different organizations too!). The repository is shown in gray next to the Issue number.

### Linked Issues and Pull Requests

Just add `#123` or `orgName/RepoName#123` to the Issue or Pull Request body and linked Issues will show up with the column they are in, both below the Card and in the preview popup.

### Real-Time Collaboration

By clicking the :pencil2: icon next to the card title, multiple people can edit the Issue Body at once (ie in a meeting), and when editing is done, one person clicks <kbd>Save to GitHub</kbd>.

Features:

- send anyone the link to edit
- real-time preview of Markdown
- references to Issues show with their state and board column
- Sequence, State, Gantt, and other diagrams are supported (using [mermaid](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/))

### Filtering

- cards can be filtered by label, milestone, board column, or user
- filters can be inclusive as well as exclusive

![gh-board_filters](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/253202/13621706/958fafec-e567-11e5-9411-405de7f34664.gif)


### Milestone Planning

When doing Milestone (or Sprint) planning there is a view to easily move cards into milestones

![gh-board_milestone-planning](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/253202/13621710/9e763c98-e567-11e5-95bd-6473ffedd0ef.gif)

### Moving Cards

Cards can be dragged from one column to the next

![gh-board_moving-cards](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/253202/13621716/a4ea20f8-e567-11e5-9150-795f1acf89e9.gif)

### Task Lists

By using the `- [ ]` notation in the body of an Issue or Pull Request, the progress of an Issue is shown in the top-right corner of a Card.

![gh-board_task-lists](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/253202/13621813/523b1438-e568-11e5-997f-5f5014456783.gif)

### CI Status and Merge Conflict

- CI Status shows up as a green :heavy_check_mark: or a red :x: on the top-right corner of a card
- Merge conflicts are shown with a yellow :warning: and have a diagonal striped background

### Burnup Chart

[Why Burnup instead of Burndown?](http://brodzinski.com/2012/10/burn-up-better-burn-down.html)

Shows a burnup chart for a Milestone (ie "Sprint" or "Iteration").
If you use select multiple repositories it will include all of them.

It also skips when nothing was opened or closed that day/month/year (useful to see weekends or holidays).

# Issue Image

If an Issue or Pull Request contains an image then it will be shown in the Issue

### Pull Request to non-default branch

Sometimes Pull Requests go to a branch other than the main branch. This makes it clear when that happens.

### Batch-Edit Labels in Multiple Repositories

If you need to rename a column or remove a duplicate label you can get to this page from the Settings dropdown next to the filter link.

# Easter Eggs

Plus, it comes with totally useful easter eggs you can unlock!

![easter-eggs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/253202/14037438/185532ee-f21a-11e5-8b83-20f8cd21b753.gif)


# Examples

Just specify a GitHub repository in the URL and off you go!

- [openstax/tutor-js](http://philschatz.com/gh-board/#/r/openstax:tutor-js)
- [openstax/tutor-js + tutor-server](http://philschatz.com/gh-board/#/r/openstax:tutor-js|tutor-server) (multiple repositories)
- [huboard/huboard](http://philschatz.com/gh-board/#/r/huboard:huboard)
- [jquery/jquery](http://philschatz.com/gh-board/#/r/jquery:jquery)
- Or wildcards! (must be logged in) using `http://philschatz.com/gh-board/#/r/openstax:tutor-js|*`


# Development

- `npm start` to start up the dev server and go to `http://localhost:8080`
- `npm run build` to generate the JS and CSS files in `./dist`

### How Does it Work?

- JavaScript calls the GitHub API and pulls in the Issues for a given repository.
  - Since there is no server to do OAuth, people need to provide a GitHub token which is stored in `localStorage`
- It uses the first repository to get the Issue Labels and Milestones.
- There are special Labels which represent the board columns (in the format `# - Column Title`)
- To be a "Good API Citizen" `gh-board` uses eTags provided by GitHub and saves them in `localStorage` (or `IndexedDB`)


### Hosting your own Forked Version

1. create a fork
2. switch to the `gh-pages` branch
3. make a commit and push it to `gh-pages` (to trigger GitHub to start hosting the files)
4. go to `https://${USERNAME}.github.io/gh-board/`

###### To make edits and push them up on GitHub

1. make edits in the src directory in `master`
2. commit your changes
3. run `npm run deploy`

###### To update your fork with the upstream (this repo)

1. `git pull https://github.com/philschatz/gh-board.git master`
2. run `npm run deploy`
